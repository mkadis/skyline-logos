Skyline Baseball League Logo Package
====================================

This is a logo package which contains all league and team logos for the Skyline Baseball League, an Out of the Park Baseball Online simulation league.

Place each folder in the follow paths in your game:

## League Logos
`/saved_games/xxxxx.lg/news/html/images/`

## Team Logos
`/saved_games/xxxxx.lg/news/html/images/`

## Ballcaps
`/saved_games/xxxxx.lg/ballcaps/`

## Jerseys
`/saved_games/xxxxx.lg/jerseys/`

***

- Please note if there is a league_logos OR team_logos folder already in the images folder, you can delete the current folders and move in the new folders.
- The jerseys and ballcaps folders are used globally in your game, so if you are in multiple leagues that use custom ballcaps and jerseys, you are going to want to merge the images into the current ballcaps / jerseys folder instead of deleting or overwriting the existing folder. The easiesst way to do this is to just copy all the images inside the ballcaps and jerseys folders and pasting them into the pre-exisiting folder.
- please replace xxxxx.lg with the actual pathing of your skyline.lg file. The name will vary.
